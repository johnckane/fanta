Playing last place schedule to improve fantasy points
How does QB continuity affect predictions
How explainable are "jumps" in the data, e.g. if a WR goes 3,4,6,2,3,13,12, what comes next?
Total offense as a predictor
Stats to calculate:
1) DVOA, points against (D/ST)
2) YPA, ATPA (QB)
3) Success ratio (40% of 1st down), (60% 2nd down), (100% 3rd/4th down) (RB)
4) Catch rate, air yards reception per route (RB/WR)
5) vs. league average (K)

Split points by receptions/yards...is one more stable YOY?

Look at team rush yards as a % of top two backs and league rank totals

Forecast by P(tier) x historical tier average

Successful play vs. win prob... how to factr in time
